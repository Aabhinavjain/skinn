# derma-predict
A web based application which uses CNN (Convolution Neural Networks) Deep Learning model for skin cancer detection


Skin diseases are conditions that affect your skin. These diseases may cause rashes, inflammation, itchiness or other skin changes.

  # Types of skin cancers:
'Melanocytic Nevi (NV)
´Melanoma (MEL)
´Benign Keratosis-like Lesion (BKL)
´Dermatofibroma (DF)
´Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)
´Actinic Keratoses (Akiec)
´Vascular Lesions (Vasc)


# Objective
The objective of this project is to identify the skin diseases (cancerous )through
 images, thus making it completely non-invasive for the patient and therefore accessible in rural areas where access to dermatologists is limited.


# Technologies used:
1.Python
2.Flask Framework: for model deployment
2.TensorFlow: CNN Deep  learning Model 
4.HTML/CSS: Web Dev

# Dataset Used :
Dermoscopic lesion images were acquired from HAM10000 Dataset. A disease label for each image was determined histopathologically or diagnostically. A training dataset for classiﬁcation consisted of 10,015 images (327 AKIEC, 514 BCC, 1,099 BKL, 115 DF, 1,113 MEL, 6,705 NV, and 142 VASC samples) with the corresponding disease label (ground truth), and a validation set and a test set.


# Machine Learning Model Used:
´Convolutional Neural  Network (CNN):
In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of Artificial Neural Network(ANN), most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.
